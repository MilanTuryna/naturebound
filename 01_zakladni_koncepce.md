# 01 - Basic Concept

## 1. About the Game
- **Title:** NatureBound  
- **Genre:** 2D puzzle-platformer, logical, survival, co-op  
- **Engine:** Godot 4  
- **Platform:** Web (HTML5), later desktop  

## 2. Core Idea
Players control elemental beings — fire, water, air, and earth — each with unique abilities.  
They must **cooperate** to overcome environmental puzzles and reach the exit of each level.

## 3. Gameplay Focus
- Cooperative local multiplayer (WASD + arrow keys).  
- Logical puzzles that require using each element’s strengths.  
- Environmental hazards that punish poor coordination.  
- Increasing difficulty through three handcrafted levels.

## 4. Visual and Audio Style
- Minimalistic 2D art, colorful but simple.  
- Natural ambient sounds and soft background music.  
- Visual contrast between elements (fire glows, water flows, etc.).

## 5. Inspirations
- *Fireboy & Watergirl* – cooperative puzzle concept.  
- *It Takes Two* – teamwork mechanics.  
- *Portal 2 Co-op* – synchronized problem solving.

## 6. Project Goals
- Create a playable prototype demonstrating co-op between two players controlling different elements.  
- Later expand to online multiplayer and allow players to have additional elemental forces
